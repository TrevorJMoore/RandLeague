# RandLeague
A Java WebApp to create a loadout randomizer for League of Legends.
## Description
The RandLeague WebApp allows users to randomize their:
* Champion
* Summoner Spells
* Items
* Runes

If you are particularly bored with the game, or want to make it more challenging, this is a great start.
## Usage
The main idea with the WebApp is that it is ready out-of-the-box. Maven handles the dependencies, Spring Boot handles embedding the web server, and H2 allows for an in-memory database.

For now, to start the WebApp, just run the [**RandLeagueApplication.java** file](src/main/java/com/trevorjmoore/randleague/RandLeagueApplication.java)
and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to begin generating randomized loadouts!
